# CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy in VeraDemo
Verademo utilizes a standard number generator, which leaves back patterns or clusters of values that are likely to occur when the app is ran. Attackers can brute force these generators as the range of generated values is not sufficient.

# Mediate 
* Determine the entropy necessary for the app to adequately provide randomness. Increase number of bits of objects such as keys and seeds. 

# Remediate
* Provide a sufficient amount of randomness where an attacker would not be able to guess the outcome.
